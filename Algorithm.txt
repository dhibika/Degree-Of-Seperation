I)Degree.rb

It is for creating tree structure by using the datas what we have given.
For example

1.connection method
	To create tree structure with datas
	connection_find =Fetchdata.new()
	connection_find.connection('Amitabh Bachchan', 'Leonardo DiCaprio')
	connection_find.connection('Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Martin Scorsese')
	connection_find.connection('Martin Scorsese', 'Robert De Niro')  

2.connected method
	Return the degree of seperation between two values
	connection_find.connected?('Amitabh Bachchan', 'Robert De Niro')




II)Data.rb

To find the degree of seperation, consider you are giving value as actor1,actor2
First check whether actor1 and actor2 are directly connected ie they have any common movies or not 
If they are not connecting directly then go for looping
		1. List the movies of actor1
		2. Get the actors list from the movies of actor1
		3  Form tree (connection method)between actor1 and all actors in list 
		4. Exit loop if you find the actor2 in the list
		5. If not then again get the movies of actors in the actor list
		6. Then repeat the process from step 1
		7. Once tree is created, verify degree of seperation value with "connected" method
	

Note
Degree of Seperation currently getting from "connected" method is not minimum one.
Looping in data.rb is upto 3 level only. It is not an infinite loop.
